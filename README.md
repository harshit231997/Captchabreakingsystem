# Captchabreakingsystem
This captcha breaking system is written using Java. 
The code will be able to break a captcha which has disturbance in the form of lines and dots. 
I have used hardcoded values specific to a general case.
Working : 
By using various filters and modifying the TESSERACT-OCR, this project has been created.
I have created .war file which can be run on browser by uploading it on TOMCAT server.
